## Project Overview

ðŸ”‘ Admin & User Roles
1>Admin can:

        a.Add workspaces

        b.View and manage all bookings

        c.Update booking statuses

2>User can:

        a.Book workspaces

        b.View personal bookings

3>Validations
Frontend & Backend:

        a.Name: At least 3 characters.

        b.Phone: Exactly 10 digits.

        c.Email: Standard email format.

        d.Seats: Cannot exceed workspace capacity.

        e.Conflict Check: Prevent booking if seats are unavailable.

4>Why This Approach?
a. App Router â†’ Leverages Next.js 14 server actions and route handlers for clean API structure.

        b.JWT in HTTP-only cookie â†’ Secure authentication without exposing token to JavaScript.

        c.Prisma ORM â†’ Type-safe database queries with migrations.

        d.react-hot-toast â†’ Non-blocking, modern feedback instead of alerts.

        e.Server-side sorting & filtering â†’ Ensures correct ordering even if client manipulates data.

        f.Seeded accounts â†’ Easy testing for both roles.
